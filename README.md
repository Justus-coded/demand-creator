# DEMAND-CREATOR

Status: Prototype
-----------------
A package to create electricity demand prediction for any arbitrary shape using ML

**Data:**
- histortic and future hourly temperature time series
- histortic and future hourly humidity time series
- hourly wind speed
- yearly GDP
- ...

**General note:**
- Data should be available by default globally, in high resolution rasters (.nc format), over 30+year
- Methods should be written that more accurate local data can be integrated
- Methods should allow to modify flexibly climate change impacts on the demand

**Possible future?** Create demand timeseries for other sectors such as heat demand, industrial demand, transportation demand,
